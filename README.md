### ADSORB

ADSORB is a simple game played on an irregularly shaped 2D surface (board)
made up of an odd number of squares.

Players compete to occupy as much space on the board as possible. There are
a limited number of actions that can be made each turn. A player can either
`add` or `remove` one square or `unfold` an existing group of markers into
adjacent squares. Unfolding can be done in any direction, as long as the
squares are unoccupied.

The player who has the most squares when the board is full wins.
